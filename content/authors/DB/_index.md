I was born and raised in Saginaw, MI. From a young age, Iâ€™ve always had a passion for biomedical sciences and desired to use biomedical sciences to help the world. With this desire, I received my BS in Biochemistry from the University of Michigan Flint in 2018. Following my undergraduate years, I decided to pursue a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology at Indiana University School of Medicine where I currently study transcriptional stress using proteomics techniques. By combining my childhood passion with my doctoral training, I hope to focus on type 2 diabetes related research while also advocating for policy reform within diabetes treatment.
