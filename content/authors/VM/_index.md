Vik Meadows is a PhD candidate in the laboratory of Dr. Heather Francis, part of the Indiana Center for Liver Research at the Indiana University School of Medicine and Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center. Vikâ€™s research aims to understand the interactions between mast cells and cholangiocytes (the epithelial cells of the bile ducts) during the development and progression of cholestatic liver diseases (i.e. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis). Her current project topics include: mast cell regulation of bile acid and FXR/FGF15 signaling and the effects of chronic histamine on cholestasis. She also has an interest in intestinal inflammation and the gut/liver axis.

Outside of lab, she co-founded the #BiochemChat Diversity Seminar, which gives current PhD students fthe opportunity to meet Post-Doctoral Fellows from around the US who are advocates for representation, DEI, mental health awareness, and resilience in STEM. She served as a graduate student representative in the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force and co-student representative for the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Indiana University School of Medicine from June 2020- July 2021.
